# Railway-Reservation-System
Railway Reservation System C project (done in code::block) 

This project is small simulation of Railway reservation system management done in c programming language.
This project provides variety of menu for booking , cancel , check current status of waitlist ticket , generate pnr and 
check any details with it.

I mainly used Linked List for creating passenger details as node and for various operations like cancel and booking and transfer of waitlist ticket
to confirm ticket (if seats are vacant).
